# Data_co-learning-backend
This is an app named data, under the project named co-learning-backend. I made it for the project I was working for my office. 

Create a folder in the data directory named management. Create another folder inside the folder management, named commands. Inside the commands folder should be the file load_data.py. This file is the one that links the data fetched from the json files named country, state and city. This is very important for data collection.
